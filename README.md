# Hankel.jl
Quasi-discrete Hankel transform

This package implements the cylindrical and (hyper)spherical quasi-discrete Hankel transform (QDHT) of arbitrary order.
It also defines some primitives for compatibility with Julia's automatic differentiation ecosystem.
More details, references and a usage guide can be found in the [Documentation](https://chrisbrahms.github.io/Hankel.jl/dev).
